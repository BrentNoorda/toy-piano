kludging animations on Meteor for toy-piano <span style="float:right;"> [&#x25B2;](../README.md#interesting-bits)</span>
===============

In the chat window portion of toy-piano I wanted animated to show new chat elements (rather than tho have them just suddenly exist). But Meteor doesn't yet help with the concept of animations, such as when a new item appears in the DOM. The workarounds I found online seemed overly complicated, and so here's the simple kludge I came up with.





The chat system also keeps only the last 10 items of chat (this happens on the server). It would have been nice to have old chats fade out instead of just disappearing. That trick seemed harder than the fade-in, so I didn't even try.

### the biggest problem I hit when adding animations

The standard Meteor chat examples simply change the state of the display output when a user enters a chat message, as in this [Basic chat app](http://brh-chat.meteor.com/)  example from the top of [Made With Meteor](http://madewith.meteor.com/).

In this case everything appears fine and dandy. The user enters a new message and, boom, the message is there.

But in the toy-piano chat windoe I wanted something a little fancier. I wanted to provide visual cues to the user to about when new messages came in and where they belonged in the history. So I added some typical animations (more on how that happened later), and by the time I deployed these to the server, where lag is involved, I would sometimes see something like this:

Annoying, right?

Basically, the currently workaround, sadly, is to avoid Meteor's latency compensation thing in the first place.

Here's how I did that in the current code:

BTW, I've since learned there is a much easier workaround to my kludge to not really draw the field in the client (and thus avoid the latency compensation double-draw thing) and that is simply to not add the `addChat()` method to the client, so that new entries into the Chat table are only initiated at the server.
