Dear Meteor Development Group, here's how to make your product kick more ass<span style="float:right;"> [&#x25B2;](../README.md#for-mdg-eyes-only)</span>
===============

Dear Meteor, in working with Meteor for a short while I'm impressed that you guys are off to a great start on you radical and audacious goal of solving all the web-related software development problems. Right On!

But no more praise, for now. Instead here's a few suggestions on what you should be up to to improve Meteor. *This unsolicited advice, and a few bucks, will buy you a cup of Blue Bottle coffee, so I hope you take if for all it's worth.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Figure out the animation stuff

don't make me do silly phony template stuff just to get animation

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
how the heck is scaling going to work?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
is latency compensation just a gimmick?

seems to me more time is spent either showing of this gimmick or working around it than it's worth - the server should be faster instead!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
give us a debug what-is-happening view

show what is being redrawn, with steps, to figure out the magic

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Go a step further combining html(handlebars), css(less), & javascript...

like the weird way I passed from less to html

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...and events, do something revolutionary with events

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
develop demo version of all of today's most-popular web sites and applications

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
multiple pages done right, dammit

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
get control of the smart package environment

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
develop demo version of all of today's most-popular web sites and applications

This is the biggest bit of advice, and all of the others would probably fall out of this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
make the phone developers make better browsers

you guys have impressive credentials. convince your buddies at Apple and Google to stop making such sucky browsers so Meteor can shine on a browser as well as it does on a desktop




don't forget:

 * the freaking annoying double-display thing
 * they have this template thing going pretty well, but then it breaks where events are found (may as well use jquery)
 * too much magic still (for example had to read lots of source code, put in alerts, etc...)
 * our way or the highway
 * load order is annoying, how to make sure one thing is loaded before another
libraries might not all work exactly - need "smart packages"


 the meteor people need to make, and mimic, fraking real-worl web sites
